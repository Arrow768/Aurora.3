changes: 
  - rscadd: "Implements a multi-mode blaster pistol to the security arsenal. This weapon replaces the security taser and .45 pistol as the primary sidearm of Security Officers and the Warden, and replaces the energy pistol for the Head of Security, the Head of Pesonnel, and the Captain."
  - rscadd: "Implements a security-level restricted firing pin. This firing pin comes standard in the security model of the blaster pistol, but not the ones belonging to the Head of Security, the Head of Personnel, or the Captain."
  - maptweak: "Moves the .45 pistols and rubber .45 magazines from the Security Officer secure lockers to the armoury."
